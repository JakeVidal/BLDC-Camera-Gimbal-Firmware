### Communication Protocol Adapted For The Arduino Platform

This sub repo contains the implementation of the communication module adapter from STM32 to Arduino

***NOTES***

- The revelvant files are *Comms.h* and *COMMS_Arduino.ino*
- The project was created using **Visual Studio 2019** (explains the .sln file and the .xml files)
  - This is because a Visual Studio extension (*Visual Micro*) was used to program the Arduino
- To use without VS2019, simply open the *.ino* file in the Arduino IDE.
